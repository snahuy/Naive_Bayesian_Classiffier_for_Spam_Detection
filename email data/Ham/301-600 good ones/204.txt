i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function number simulations we use this question think is not so important when calculate because assumptions underlying are pretty rough anyway here mean regarding price processes correlations etc becomes more essential talk calculating sensitivities to various factors magnitude sensitivity comparable calculation what such performed numerical experiment where calculated expected loss for simple portfolio with one counterparty sithe ind power different using old research you can see how result converges and relative error compared which assumed be most accurate in attached file tanya
